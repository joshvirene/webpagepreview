      <p>
        We believe there are latent financial health indicators that go undetected during the screening process, leading
        to higher risk applicants being accepted when they should not be. 
        By incorporating these into the tenant screening process, our tool provides an additional layer of scrutiny, 
        protecting property managers from risk that cannot be detected by conventional techniques.

        A quick glance at these may suggest a decrease in risk to the property management companies due to a lower volume of tenants. On the contrary, we believe that this decline in both percentage and number of renting households indicates economic hardship.
        It is possible that this decrease in volume is driven by a consolidation in rentals. Such examples of this include people moving back to their parents’ home, moving in with their partner, or increasing the number of lessors in an individual lease.

        Using the Chained CPI index to adjust prices to 2021 dollars, we show that there is a real increase in the median rent price for Sacramento County. Over the period 2018-2023, the median rent price increased 35% (from $1300 to $1762).
        Having controlled for inflation, it is clear that rent is a driving factor in the overall increase in cost of living for Sacramento County. Rentals are becoming less affordable to tenants, thereby increasing property managers’ financial risk.

        Gross rent as a percentage of household income. This measure is self explanatory; it is the rent that tenants pay, as a percentage of the household income. 
        This figure illustrates the metric in bins, where GRAPHI_15 gives the households whose rent is less than, or equal to 15% of their household income, GRAPHI_15_19.9 is those whose rent is in the range 15% - 19.9%, and so on. 
        A majority of households in this survey throughout the years have rent greater than, or equal to 35% of their income. These are the households who are likely living paycheck to paycheck, and are perhaps one or two bad months away from not being able to make rent in a given month. 
        Our analytical methods aim to examine these types of households, and their spending habits closely to make a better determination of whether or not they would constitute a high risk of missing rent.

      We use a robust screening process to detect applicants who pose a financial risk. We have carefully crafted a method that 
      is equitable, and follows all relevant legislation (i.e., FEHA). Our approach has several checks to examine the financial 
      state of applicants. First, we examine spending patterns and overall financial health. The second step is to examine fraud by cross 
      validating stated information provided by the tenant on their application with both internal and external data sources. Finally, we 
      synthesize all information within our AI model, which returns a comprehensive assessment that determines the qualification status of 
      the applicant.
